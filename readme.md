# Sign Up form with React Native | Xpentra Q2 Pay Assignment

- Steps to run the program?
1. Use android studio to set up an external device.
2. Go to the directory - 'D:\abc\Login\'
3. Type command - npm start -> Press 'a' to load the mobile screen
4. Enter username as 'Xpentra' & password 'xpentra' as the credentials are predefined
5. After logging in the user has to create a new pasword after logging in for the first time.
6. After setting a new password the user has to login with the newly entered password.

Currently, the password change feature is incomplete. When users attempt to change their password and confirm the new password, 
the updated password does not get stored.As a result, users cannot log in with their newly entered password.

# This limitation arises from my current understanding of storing values in React Native. 
# I am still grasping the concepts and techniques involved, and I am actively working to enhance my understanding in this area.
# I plan to explore various methods for securely storing user credentials, such as using local storage or integrating a backend service for persistent data management. 
# This will ensure that users can successfully change their passwords and access their accounts without complications.
# I appreciate your understanding as I continue to learn and improve this aspect of the application.
